## Project Overview & Business Problem
I work as a data analyst at Udemy, an educational technology company. My manager tasked me with analyzing course revenue data to identify ways to increase earnings and monitor course performance. Since Web Development courses are highly popular, she suggested considering a price increase and needs a report for the CEO in three weeks with ideas to boost next quarter's revenue.

### Tools Used:
I used Microsoft Excel, specifically the Power Query Editor, to clean the datasets effectively and create visual insights.

### Data Analysis and Insights:

- **Course Distribution:** Out of 3,676 courses, 3,365 (92%) are paid, while 311 (8%) are free.
